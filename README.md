# AC Voltage Sensing

This project reads and displays AC voltage using a microcontroller and analog signal conditioning.

## Features
- RMS Voltage calculation
- Safe analog reading of AC signals
- Compatible with Arduino or similar boards

## Hardware Required
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Voltage divider circuit
- Isolation transformer or optocoupler
- Resistors, capacitors

## How It Works
- The AC voltage is stepped down and rectified
- The analog signal is read via ADC
- The RMS value is calculated and displayed
